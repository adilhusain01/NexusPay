# NexusPay - Decentralized Payment System

## Project Overview

As an entrepreneur, I've identified a need for a decentralized payment system that allows clients to easily make crypto payments to sellers. The key objectives of my project are:

1. **Seller Dashboard**: Provide a user-friendly interface for sellers to manage their payment requests, view their balance, and withdraw funds.
2. **Client Dashboard**: Enable clients to easily find and pay for goods or services by scanning QR codes or searching for active payment requests.
3. **Secure Transactions**: Leverage blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and immutable payment processing.
4. **Flexible Integration**: Design the system to be easily integrated into various e-commerce platforms or standalone applications.

## Key Features

1. **Seller Registration**: Sellers can register on the platform to start accepting crypto payments.
2. **Payment Request Generation**: Sellers can create payment requests with customizable details like amount, expiry duration, and a QR code for clients to scan.
3. **Payment Processing**: Clients can scan QR codes or search for payment requests and complete the payment process directly from the client dashboard.
4. **Seller Balance Tracking**: Sellers can view their total balance, pending balance, and withdrawn balance, as well as withdraw funds as needed.
5. **Expiration and Cancellation**: Payment requests can expire after a set duration, and sellers can cancel active requests if needed.
6. **Transactional History**: The platform maintains a record of all payments, allowing both clients and sellers to view their transaction history.
